    <string name="cloud_cumulus_desc">Cumulus clouds are the big, white, fluffy ones that look like cotton candy or popcorn floating in the sky. They usually show up on sunny days and have flat bottoms and rounded tops, making them perfect for spotting shapes!\n\nThese clouds are formed when warm air rises and cools down, turning into tiny water droplets. Even though they look soft and light, a single cumulus cloud can weigh as much as 100 elephants!\n\nNext time you see a cumulus cloud, look closely at its shape. Sometimes they grow tall like giant towers or mountains—these are called towering cumulus. If they keep growing, they might even turn into storm clouds, but most of the time, they just drift by lazily, making the sky look like a big blue ocean with white islands.</string>
    <string name="cloud_stratus_desc">Stratus clouds look like a huge, flat grey blanket that covers the whole sky. They usually hang low and can make the day feel a bit gloomy, sometimes bringing a light drizzle or mist along with them.\n\nYou can think of stratus clouds as fog that just hasn't touched the ground yet. They form when a large mass of moist air is lifted up slowly, spreading out evenly across the horizon like a giant sheet.\n\nBecause they cover so much of the sky, stratus clouds are like a giant sunscreen for the Earth. They reflect a lot of the sun\'s heat back into space, which helps keep us cool on hot days. They might not be the most exciting clouds to look at, but they play a very important role in keeping our planet\'s temperature just right.</string>
    <string name="cloud_cirrus_desc">Cirrus clouds are very high up in the sky and look like thin, wispy white feathers or locks of hair. Because they are so high where it's super cold, they aren't made of water drops like other clouds, but tiny ice crystals instead!\n\nThese delicate clouds often mean that the weather is about to change in a day or two. Pilots love them because they are beautiful, but they can also indicate strong winds high up in the atmosphere called the jet stream.\n\nIf you watch cirrus clouds over a few hours, you might notice they seem to move very fast. That\'s because they are caught in high-speed winds way up where planes fly. Even though they look like they are standing still, they can actually be racing across the sky at over 100 miles per hour!</string>
    <string name="cloud_nimbus_desc">Nimbus clouds are the dark, heavy clouds that tell you it\'s time to grab your umbrella! They are full of water and usually mean that rain, snow, or even a thunderstorm is on the way.\n\nThe word \"nimbus\" actually means \"rain\" in Latin. These clouds are very thick and block out most of the sunlight, which is why they look so dark and grey from down here on the ground.\n\nWhile they might look a bit scary, nimbus clouds are actually very helpful! They bring the water that plants, trees, and animals need to grow. Without these rain-carrying clouds, our world wouldn\'t be nearly as green and full of life as it is today. So, instead of being sad when you see them, think of them as the sky\'s way of giving the Earth a big, refreshing drink.</string>
    <string name="star_capella_desc">Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga and the sixth brightest star in the entire night sky! Even though it looks like just one point of light, it is actually a family of four stars dancing together. Two are large yellow giants, much bigger than our Sun, and the other two are small, dim red dwarfs that are much harder to see.\n\nThe name Capella means \"little goat\" in Latin. In ancient stories, it was often pictured as a goat being carried by a charioteer. Because it is so bright and far north, people in most of the world can see it almost every night of the year. It’s like a reliable glowing beacon high up in the sky!\n\nAstronomers love studying Capella because its yellow giants are similar in color to our own Sun, but much older. By watching how these stars move around each other, scientists can learn a lot about how stars live and grow. It’s amazing to think that what looks like a single star is actually a busy cosmic neighborhood!</string>
    <string name="star_castor_desc">Castor is one of the \"Twin Stars\" in the constellation Gemini, along with its brother star, Pollux. While they look like twins from Earth, Castor is very special because it isn’t just one star—it’s actually six stars! They are grouped into three pairs that all orbit around a common center, like a complex celestial ballet.\n\nEven though it is called the second brightest star in Gemini, it is actually a very powerful group. The stars in the Castor system are mostly hot, white stars that shine much more brightly than our Sun. If you had a powerful telescope, you might be able to see that there is more than one star there, but to our eyes, they blend into one beautiful spark.\n\nFor thousands of years, sailors and travelers have used Castor and Pollux to find their way across the oceans. In Greek mythology, the twins were said to protect people at sea. Today, we know that Castor is about 51 light-years away, which means the light you see tonight started its journey to Earth over 50 years ago!</string>
    <string name="star_sirius_desc">Sirius is the undisputed champion of the night sky—it is the brightest star we can see from Earth! It is so bright that it often looks like it’s twinkling with many different colors, especially when it is low on the horizon. Because it is part of the constellation Canis Major (the Big Dog), it is famously known as the \"Dog Star.\"\n\nSirius is actually a binary star system, which means it has two members: Sirius A and Sirius B. Sirius A is the big, bright star we see, while Sirius B is a tiny \"white dwarf\" that astronomers nicknamed \"The Pup.\" Even though Sirius B is about the same size as Earth, it is so heavy that a single teaspoon of it would weigh as much as an elephant!\n\nBecause it is so bright, Sirius has been important to cultures all over the world for a long time. The ancient Egyptians watched for Sirius to appear in the morning sky to know when the Nile River was about to flood and water their crops. It’s not just a pretty light; it’s a star that has helped humans for thousands of years.</string>
    <string name="star_rigel_desc">Rigel is a magnificent blue supergiant star located in the constellation Orion, marking what looks like the giant\'s left foot. It is one of the hottest and most massive stars in our galaxy! If Rigel were as close to us as our Sun, it would be so bright that it would look like a giant blue fireball in the sky, and we would need a lot of sunscreen!\n\nThis star is a real powerhouse, shining with the light of tens of thousands of Suns combined. Its beautiful blue-white color tells us that it is burning very hot. Because it is so huge and energetic, Rigel won\'t live as long as smaller stars like our Sun. It is a star that \"lives fast and dies young\" in cosmic terms.\n\nRigel is also part of a larger system, with at least two smaller companion stars that are much harder to see. It sits near a famous cloud of gas called the Witch Head Nebula, which it lights up with its powerful blue glow. When you look at Orion on a clear night, Rigel is the brilliant blue spark that balances out the reddish star, Betelgeuse, on the other side.</string>
